## PickMeUp - jQuery datepicker plugin

Really simple, powerful and customizable datepicker.

Author - Nazar Mokrynskyi

Based on DatePicker by Stefan Petre

Browser support:
* IE 10+
* Opera 12.1+
* Latest versions of Firefox and Chrome

## [Demo](http://nazar-pc.github.io/PickMeUp)

## Getting started
You need only 2 files: `js/jquery.pickmeup.min.js` and `css/pickmeup.min.css`.

The plugin can also be loaded as AMD or CommonJS module.

Then you can apply datepicker to any element:
```javascript
$('.date').pickmeup();
```
Global default settings are stored in `$.pickmeup`

They can be redefined during initialization:
```javascript
$('.date').pickmeup({
	format	: 'Y-m-d'
});
```

or with data-attributes with `pmu-` prefix:
```html
<div class="date" data-pmu-format="Y-m-d"></div>
```

## Twitter Bootstrap integration
For Twitter Bootstrap integration you do not need to include style file, but you need to include `jquery.pickmeup.twitter-bootstrap.js` instead,
that will read settings of current Bootstrap theme and apply them to PickMeUp, so that it will look similar to native Bootstrap elements.

To apply integrated version, replace `pickmeup` with `pickmeup_twitter_bootstrap` in initialization:
```javascript
$('.date').pickmeup_twitter_bootstrap();
```
All options and events are the same.

## UIkit integration
For UIkit integration you do not need to include style file, but you need to include `jquery.pickmeup.uikit.js` instead,
that will read settings of current UIkit theme and apply them to PickMeUp, so that it will look similar to native UIkit elements.

To apply integrated version, replace `pickmeup` with `pickmeup_uikit` in initialization:
```javascript
$('.date').pickmeup_uikit();
```
All options and events are the same.

##### object render (date)
Triggered on day element rendering, accepts date as argument and may return object with next properties:
* `selected`: if `true` - date will be selected

## Methods
Methods allows external control on datepicker

$('.date').pickmeup('show');
```

$('.date').pickmeup('next');
```

```javascript
$('.date').pickmeup('get_date', formatted);
```
`formatted` - boolean or string (default `false`)
* `false` - `Date` object
* `true` - string formatted in accordance with `format` option
* string is used to specify custom format instead if given during initialization

##### Set date
```javascript
$('.date').pickmeup('set_date', date);
```
`date` - can be single date string/object or array depending on selection mode

##### Clear multiple selection
```javascript
$('.date').pickmeup('clear');
```

##### Update datepicker

```javascript
$('.date').pickmeup('update');

##### Destroy datepicker
Destroys PickMeUp instance, removes created markup, restores everything that was changed to original state.
```javascript
$('.date').pickmeup('destroy');
```

## Other
Current options (for whatever reason) can be accessed as `$('...').data('pickmeup-options')`.

Root pickmeup element (jQuery collection object) can be accessed as `$('...').get(0).pickmeup` or directly `this.pickmeup` if inside callback.

## Styling
If you want other colors - just change several variables in scss file.

To change size - adjust `font-size` for root datepicker element, everything will scale nicely.
